## 🎯 Features

- Add/remove graph nodes and edges dynamically
- Visualize graphs through a user-friendly interface
- Backend logic separated from UI for better maintainability
- Testable core logic with examples

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `tkinter` for GUI (usually comes preinstalled)
- `matplotlib` for visualization
- `networkx` for graph management

### 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx
```

### ▶️ Run the Project

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 Modules Overview

| Folder       | Purpose                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| `gui/`       | Contains the GUI logic using Tkinter |
| `logic/`     | Core functionality for graphs    |
| `visualizer/`| Graph rendering using matplotlib |
| `main.py`    | Connects all modules together    |

---

## 🧪 Testing

You can run `logic/test.py` to test core graph logic separately.

```bash
python logic/test.py
```

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project is designed to enhance understanding of:
- Modular programming in Python
- GUI creation using Tkinter
- Data visualization
- Graph data structures and their operations
